Twitter bot API

Hi this is the first bot i program using the twitter apis along with javascript.
I will keep studying javascript so more and more I can improve it.
And maybe in the future use database with javascript


1.bot.js: space to program your bot and decide what to do and what to do.


2.config.js:  space where you need to enter your twitter account keys and access tokens


3.package-lock: npm packege.


4.package:  bot information.

5. If you want to help me making this bot more interesting, add a phrase to the bot, fork your setup and add as phrases in the "r" vector and commit as changes so I can update it from Heroku.
